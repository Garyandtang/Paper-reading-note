# Paper-reading-record

Notes on my paper reading. In particular, I am working on **control, estimation, optimization and robotics**, hence most papers are in this fields. Recently, I am interested in **learning-based control**, such that some paper are in this field.

Besides, some interesting and useful notes are also achieved here.

## Trajectory optimization
